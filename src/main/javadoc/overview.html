	<b>Checkers Game</b>
	<p>Authors: Adrian Prorok, Bartlomiej Olber</p>
	<p>Peer-to-peer game. Written using Model-View-Controller pattern. Communication between server and client sides is based on java.NIO
	tools. User's interface is designed as event-driven. </p>
        <p>The event listener is waiting for user's actions and allows to handle them. Thanks to this, the other components of the program can obtain, 
        process and update game status information. </p>
        <p>The use of the Swing library enabled us to graphically present our entire application.</p>
	<p>Both sides are multithreaded. For client side threads synchronization BlockingQueues provided in Java Concurrent library. 
	The sequence diagram below shows briefly the way Controllers'</p>
        <p>threads communicate with each other.</p>

	<p>In the project we also use Jackson ObjectMapper class as serializer/deserializer of Java objects to JSON format text and vice versa.
	The Mapper is included as dependency in pom.xml file.</p>
		<p>The communication between server and client sides is based on Message subsclasses.
		 Polymorphic Requests and Responses are sent/received between the communicating sides. Below is shown Message class diagram. </p>

	<p>Following the principles taken from the MVC software design pattern, we divided our application into three cooperating modules.</p>
        <p>Below is a diagram that presents them, shows the classes contained in each module and describes the cooperation between the modules.</p>
