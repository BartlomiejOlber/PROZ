	<b>Checkers Game</b>
	<p>Authors: Adrian Prorok, Bartlomiej Olber</p>
	<p>Peer-to-peer game. Written using Model-View-Controller pattern. Communication between server and client sides is based on java.NIO
	tools. User's interface is designed as event-driven...</p>
	<p>Both sides are multithreaded. For client side threads synchronization BlockingQueues provided in Java Concurrent library. 
	The sequence diagram below shows briefly the way Controllers' threads communicate with each other.</p>
	<p>In the project we also use Jackson ObjectMapper class as serializer/deserializer of Java objects to JSON format text and vice versa.
	The Mapper is included as dependency in pom.xml file.</p>
